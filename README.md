# Nix expressions for VS Code Extensions

At the time of writing this, `nixpkgs` contains **271** `VS Code` extensions. This is a small fraction of the more than **40,000** extensions in the `VS Code Marketplace`! In addition, many of the extensions in `nixpkgs` are significantly out-of-date.

This flake provides Nix expressions for the majority of available extensions from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/) and [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode). A `GitHub Action` updates the extensions daily.

That said, you can now use a different set of extensions for `VS Code`/`VSCodium` in each of your projects. Moreover, you can share your flakes and cache them so that other people don't need to install these extensions manually!

## Note

- Extension names and publishers are lowercased.
- If an extension's publisher or name aren't valid Nix identifiers, you may access them by quoting the attribute names like `vscode-marketplace."4"."2"`.
- You may search the repo to find out at what commit a given extension was available.
- We have a permission from MS to use a crawler on their API in this case (see the [discussion](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/208456)). Please, don't abuse this flake!

## Template

This repository provides a [template](template/flake.nix).
This template provides a [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) with a couple of extensions.
Try it:

```console
nix flake new vscodium-project -t github:nix-community/nix-vscode-extensions
cd vscodium-project
git init && git add .
nix develop
```

This will print extensions available in the `VSCodium`.

Run `codium .` or `nix run .#codium .` to start `VSCodium` in the current directory.

In case of problems see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Example

There's a sample package `vscodium-with-extensions` with a couple of extensions that you can try.

```console
nix run github:nix-community/nix-vscode-extensions#vscodium-with-extensions -- --list-extensions
```

## Usage

### Extensions

We provide extensions attrsets that contain both universal and platform-specific extensions.
We use a reasonable mapping between the sites target platforms and Nix-supported platforms (see the [issue](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-vscode-extensions/issues/20) and `systemPlatform` in [flake.nix](./flake.nix)).

There are several attrsets:

- `vscode-marketplace` and `open-vsx` contain the latest versions of extensions, including pre-release ones. Such pre-release versions expire in some time. That's why, there are `-release` attrsets.
- `vscode-marketplace-release` and `open-vsx-release` contain the release versions of extensions (see [Release extensions](#release-extensions)).
- `forVSCodeVersion "4.228.1"` allows to leave only the extensions [compatible](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#visual-studio-code-compatibility) with the `"4.228.1"` version of `VS Code`.
  - You may supply the actual version of your `VS Code` instead of `"4.228.1"`.

### With flakes

See [Template](#template).

Add the following to your `flake.nix` (see [Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)).

```nix
inputs.nix-vscode-extensions.url = "github:nix-community/nix-vscode-extensions";
```

### Without flakes

```nix
let 
  system = builtins.currentSystem;
  extensions =
    (import (builtins.fetchGit {
      url = "https://github.com/nix-community/nix-vscode-extensions";
      ref = "refs/heads/master";
      rev = "c43d9089df96cf8aca157762ed0e2ddca9fcd71e";
    })).extensions.${system};
  extensionsList = with extensions.vscode-marketplace; [
      rust-lang.rust-analyzer
  ];
in ...
```

## Explore

Explore extensions in `nix repl`.

Use your system instead of `x86_64-linux`.

Press the `Tab` button (denoted as `<TAB>` here) to see attrset attributes.

## Contribute

### Issues

Resolve [issues](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-vscode-extensions/issues).

### README

- Fix links.
- Write new sections.
- Update commit SHA used in examples if they're too old.
- Enhance text.

### Release extensions

The [config](.github/config.yaml) contains several extensions.
We cache the information about the latest **release** versions of these extensions (see [Extensions](#extensions)).
If you'd like to use release versions of an extension, please, add that extension to the config and make a Pull Request.

### Extra extensions

The [extra-extensions.toml](extra-extensions.toml) file contains a list of extensions to be fetched from places other than `VS Code Marketplace` and `Open VSX`.
Add necessary extensions there, preferrably, for all supported platforms (see [Extensions](#extensions)).
[nvfetcher](https://github.com/berberman/nvfetcher) will fetch the latest release versions of these extensions and write configs to [generated.nix](data/extra-extensions/generated.nix).

### Main flake

1. (Optionally) Install [direnv](https://direnv.net/), e.g., via `nix profile install nixpkgs#direnv`.

1. Run a devshell. When prompted about `extra-trusted-substituters` answer `y`. This is to use binary caches.

    ```console
    nix develop nix-dev/
    ```

1. (Optionally) Start `VSCodium` with necessary extensions and tools.

    ```console
    nix run nix-dev/#writeSettings
    nix run nix-dev/#codium .
    ```

### Haskell script

1. See the [README](./haskell/README.md).

1. Get the environment.

    ```console
    set -a
    source .env
    ```

1. Run the script.

    ```console
    nix run haskell/#updateExtensions
    ```

### Pull requests

Pull requests are welcome!

## Troubleshooting

- If `Nix`-provided `VSCodium` doesn't pick up the extensions:
  - Close other instance of `Nix`-provided `VSCodium`.
  - Try to reboot your computer and start `VSCodium` again.
- See [troubleshooting](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/blob/main/README/Troubleshooting.md).
